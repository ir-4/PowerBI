**Overview**<br>
Welcome to the "Superstore Data Visuals" project! This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the performance of a superstore using Power BI. The dataset used for analysis is stored in [superstore.csv](https://github.com/ir-4/PowerBI/blob/main/Superstore%20data%20visuals/superstore.csv), and you can find visualizations in [Visualization for Superstore.ipynb](https://github.com/ir-4/PowerBI/blob/main/Superstore%20data%20visuals/Visualization%20for%20Superstore.pbix) file.

**Dataset**<br>
The dataset, [superstore.csv](https://github.com/ir-4/PowerBI/blob/main/Superstore%20data%20visuals/superstore.csv), contains essential information about the superstore's sales, customers, categories, and more. It includes attributes such as customer ID, product category, sales revenue, and others, which are crucial for conducting a comprehensive analysis.

**Data Cleaning and Exploration**<br>
Before proceeding with the Power BI visualization, the dataset underwent thorough cleaning and exploration. For detailed insights into this process, please refer [link](https://github.com/ir-4/Data-Analysis-using-Python/blob/main/Superstore%20Performance%20Analysis/Data%20Analysis.ipynb).

**Power BI Visualizations**<br>
The visualization for the Superstore Analysis has been created using Power BI and is available in the visualization for superstore.pbix file. It consists of two main visual analysis dashboards:

_1. Customer Analysis_<br>
The "Customer Analysis" dashboard provides valuable insights into customer-related metrics and behavior. It includes the following visualizations:
- Customer Traffic over Year: A line chart depicting the number of customers visiting the store over different months or years to identify trends.<br>
- Top Contributing Customers: A table or chart showcasing the top customers contributing the most to the store's sales revenue.<br>
- Customer Share over Various Categories: A bar chart presenting the distribution of customers across different product categories.<br>
...Add more details about other visualizations specific to customer analysis

_2. Sales Analysis_<br>
The "Sales Analysis" dashboard focuses on sales revenue metrics and performance. It includes the following visualizations:<br>
- Sales Revenue over Year: A line chart displaying the sales revenue trend over different time periods, such as months or years.<br>
- Sales Revenue for Different Subcategories: A column chart or pie chart representing sales revenue for various subcategories of products.<br>
- Top Performing States and Cities: Maps or charts highlighting the top states and cities with the highest sales revenue.<br>
...Add more details about other visualizations specific to sales analysis<br>
