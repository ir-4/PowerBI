**Overview**  
Welcome to the "Power BI - Data Visualization for Books Dataset"! This folder contains data and visualizations related to a cleaned dataset of books. This consists of three files: [dashboards.pbix](https://github.com/ir-4/PowerBI/blob/main/Data%20visualization%20for%20Books%20dataset/Dashboards.pbix), [books.csv](https://github.com/ir-4/PowerBI/blob/main/Data%20visualization%20for%20Books%20dataset/books.csv), and [exploring data.ipynb](https://github.com/ir-4/PowerBI/blob/main/Data%20visualization%20for%20Books%20dataset/Exploring%20data.ipynb).

**Dataset**  
The dataset, [books.csv](https://github.com/ir-4/PowerBI/blob/main/Data%20visualization%20for%20Books%20dataset/books.csv), is a cleaned and preprocessed collection of book-related information. It includes attributes such as title, author, publisher, average rating, and more.

**Exploring Data**  
To begin the analysis process, we first explored the dataset in exploring data.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook. This notebook contains basic functions for reading the CSV file, displaying a list of attributes, summarizing the data, and other exploratory tasks. Since it is a cleaned dataset, no additional cleaning process was required.

**Power BI Dashboards**  
Two interactive Power BI dashboards have been created based on the insights gained from exploring the data. These dashboards offer a user-friendly and visually engaging way to explore the dataset's characteristics. The two dashboards are as follows:

_1. Top Authors Dashboard_  
The "Top Authors Dashboard" provides valuable information about the top 5 authors in the dataset. It includes the following visualizations:
Book Count and Average rating per Author: A clustered bar chart showing the distribution of book counts and average rating for each of the top 5 authors.
Language Distribution: A pie chart representing the distribution of books across different languages.
...Add more details about other visualizations specific to top authors

_2. Publishers Dashboard_  
The "Publishers Dashboard" highlights key insights related to publishers in the dataset. The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
Book and Author Count per Publisher: A clustered column chart showcasing the number of books and authors associated with each publisher.
Publications Over Time: A line chart depicting the trend of publications over time for different publishers.
...Add more details about other visualizations specific to publishers
