**Overview**
Welcome to the "Power BI - Data Visualization for Books Dataset"! This folder contains data and visualizations related to a cleaned dataset of books. This consists of three files: dashboards.pbix, books.csv, and exploring data.ipynb.

**Dataset**
The dataset, books.csv, is a cleaned and preprocessed collection of book-related information. It includes attributes such as title, author, publisher, average rating, and more.

**Exploring Data**
To begin the analysis process, we first explored the dataset in exploring data.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook. This notebook contains basic functions for reading the CSV file, displaying a list of attributes, summarizing the data, and other exploratory tasks. Since it is a cleaned dataset, no additional cleaning process was required.

**Power BI Dashboards**
Two interactive Power BI dashboards have been created based on the insights gained from exploring the data. These dashboards offer a user-friendly and visually engaging way to explore the dataset's characteristics. The two dashboards are as follows:
